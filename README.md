# projet6

We have the choice to create a private repository which is paid or public which is free. To create a repository. 
You have to create a github account and connect to your account. 
Once connected, click on the button "Create new" symbolized by a sign "+" at the top right of your screen, then "New repository".
GitHub will then ask you to specify some details about your repository: its name, its description, its public or private status. 
We will take the case where the user selects public.
Then we also have an option "Initialize with a README", which allows you to clone your repository on your machine. 
This option is checked only in case you have not yet created the repository in question on your machine. 
And now you can clone your project and bring it back to your machine with the git clone command, make commits and view commits.
